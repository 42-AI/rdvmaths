# Pratical training: Functions 1

This worksheet tackles the very basics of the functions.
The notions covered are:
- basics vocabulary,
- representation of a line using it cartesian and reduced form equation,
- determination of the cartesian and reduced form equation by calculus and graphical analysis,
- solve system of equations (linear system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns),
- recognize reference functions (squared, squared root, inverse ...),
- modeling a problem with an equation and resolve it,


## Exercices

### Exercise 1:
Given 2 straight lines (AB) and (CD).
1. What are the coordinates of the intersection point between (AB) and the x-axis and y-axis.
2. Give 3 points with integer coordinates which are on the line (CD).
3. By graphical reading, give the coordinates of the intersection point between the 2 straight lines.

### Exercise 2:
1. Calculate the cartesian equation of the line passing throught the point A $(1;-2)$ and of director vector $\vec{AB}\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\
3
\end{pmatrix}
$.
2. Calculate the cartesian equation of the line passing throught the point A $(-3;-2)$ and of director vector $\vec{AB}\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$.

### Exercise 3:
1. Plot the function of equation $y=-2x+3$.
2. Plot the function of equation $y=\frac{4}{5}x-\frac{3}{5}$.

### Exercise 4:
Given the straight lines represented in the graph below:

1. Determine the slope of the straight lines.
2.  Determine the intercept of the straight lines.
3.  Give the reduced form of the equations of the straight lines.

### Exercise 5:
Calculate the slope, the reduced form and finally the intercept of the lines:
1. (AB) with $A(-2;-3)$ and $B(1;2)$.
2. (CD) with $C(1;-2)$ and $D(-1;2)$.
3. (MN) with $M(0;3)$ and $N(-2;-2)$.


### Exercise 6:
1. Solve the following systems:

$$
(\mathcal{S}_1) = \begin{cases}-2x + 3y + 2 &=& 0\\x + -2y - 3 &=& 0 \end{cases}
$$

$$
(\mathcal{S}_2) = \begin{cases}-3x - 2y - 2 &=& 0\\4x + y + 5 &=& 0 \end{cases}
$$

$$
(\mathcal{S}_3) = \begin{cases} 3x + 4y - 2 &=& 0\\2x - y - 5 &=& 0 \end{cases}
$$
